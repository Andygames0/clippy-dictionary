# Clippy Dictionary

Comments dictionary for https://github.com/capJavert/clippy

### Contribute
Clippy fetches comments from this repository file: https://clippy-dictionary.kickass.website - Feel free to contribute new comments for your favorite sites by making a pull request
- Entries are filled in format ```"keyword": "comment"```
- For example sitename for github.com would be 'github', but it could also be "com" which would add this comment for all sites containing ".com" in URL
- You can also define an array of comments like ```"keyword: ["comment1", "comment2"]```
- If there are multiple comments for the same site Clippy will pick a random one
- I will try to merge any pull requests on regular basis
- Feel free to build and install your own version of Clippy if you don't want to wait for next update
